This project explores the advanced type system feature known only as Typerec, which allows for very sophisticated
kinds of constraints to be expressed by the type-system, in the form of type-operators.

For more information about the theory of type-systems, and my implementation of the Typerec construct in an original language, see the report and the poster in this repository.
